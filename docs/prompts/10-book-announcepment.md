🚀 Excited to announce: A brand new AI-powered intelligent textbook is here! 🎉

  Over coffee last Friday with a brilliant UMN computer science senior, I realized there was a gap in how we teach the
   journey from basic search to cutting-edge chatbots. So I did what any educator would do on a Saturday morning—I
  fired up Claude Code and created an entire interactive textbook! ☕➡️📚

  "Building Conversational AI: From Search to GraphRAG" is now live and ready to help students and practitioners
  master chatbot development.

  📊 What's inside this intelligent textbook?

  ✅ 14 comprehensive chapters covering everything from AI foundations to GraphRAG
  ✅ 200 interconnected concepts with a learning dependency graph
  ✅ 118,496 words (equivalent to ~485 pages!)
  ✅ 130 quiz questions aligned to Bloom's Taxonomy
  ✅ 43 interactive diagrams and visualizations waiting to come alive
  ✅ 36 equations for the math lovers
  ✅ 384 hyperlinks to resources and examples
  ✅ 310 sections of detailed content

  🎨 The journey spans:
  - Search technologies & semantic search
  - Large language models & embeddings
  - Vector databases & intent recognition
  - Chatbot frameworks & UI design
  - RAG (Retrieval Augmented Generation)
  - Knowledge graphs & GraphRAG
  - NLP pipelines & security
  - Performance optimization & careers

  This is a Level 2+ intelligent textbook built with AI assistance, featuring concept dependency graphs, interactive
  MicroSims, and learning objectives aligned to cognitive outcomes. It's designed for college sophomores but useful
  for anyone building production chatbots.

  🎯 The best part? It's all open source and continuously evolving!

  While the diagram descriptions are still placeholders waiting to become interactive visualizations, the foundation
  is solid and ready to help learners on their AI journey.

While the diagram descriptions are still placeholders waiting to become interactive visualizations, the foundation is solid and ready to help learners on their AI journey. If you want to learn AI we can work together to build the MicroSims out. If you are an instructor, tell me what you like or don't like about the structure of the book. It is easy to regenerate with a different course description. If you are a chatbot expert or a conversation designer, I would also love your input.
