# Course Description for Conversational AI

**Title:** Conversational AI
**Grade Level:** College Sophomores

## Course Overview

This course teaches how to use AI technologies to build conversational agents such as chatbots.
Our first project will cover building a simple chatbot that answers questions about information in text files.
We then build more advanced chatbots that can call services.
We briefly cover what traditional search is and some of the challenges of traditional keyword search.
We then discuss semantic search and how it provides better results than traditional keyword search.
We discuss how we measure search quality and introduce terms such as precision, recall and F-Measures.
We then discuss search performance including reverse indexes and Page Rank.
We then move into AI topics including LLMs, Tokenization and FAQs analysis.
We then introduce the concept of logging chatbot results and feedback.
We cover the use of chatbot logs to analyze the most frequent questions with incorrect answers.
We discuss chatbot user interface tools.
Our first project is building a simple chatbot that does keyword only search.
Then we introduce embeddings, vector stores  NLP pipelines and the RAG pattern.
We show the limitations of RAG and how to improve results with the GraphRAG pattern.
We then show how GraphRAG depends on curated knowledge graphs and how these knowledge graphs can become the central nervous system of an organization. 
Next, we discuss how ChatBots can be used to call database services.
We discuss the process of matching questions to queries and extracting parameters from the questions.
Finally we discuss the context of the user, security concerns and role-based access.
We wrap up with a final capstone project.
