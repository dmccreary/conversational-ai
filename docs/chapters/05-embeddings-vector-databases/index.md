# Embeddings and Vector Databases

## Summary

This chapter explores how words and sentences can be represented as numerical vectors in high-dimensional spaces, enabling machines to understand semantic relationships between text. You will learn about various embedding models including Word2Vec, GloVe, and FastText, understand vector space models and dimensionality, and discover how vector databases enable fast similarity searches. These technologies are essential for semantic search and retrieval-augmented generation systems.
