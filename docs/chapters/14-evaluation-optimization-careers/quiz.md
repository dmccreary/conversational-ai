What does KPI stand for?

1. Key Performance Indicator
2. Knowledge Process Integration
3. Kernel Process Interrupt
4. Known Problem Identifier

??? question "Show Answer"
    The correct answer is **A**.

    [KPI](../../glossary.md#key-performance-indicator) stands for Key Performance Indicator - a measurable value that demonstrates how effectively an organization or system is achieving key business objectives.

## Question 5

<div class="upper-alpha" markdown>

What is optimization in the chatbot context?

1. Making the chatbot code as short as possible
2. Improving chatbot performance, efficiency, and effectiveness through systematic changes
3. Reducing the number of features
4. Increasing server costs

??? question "Show Answer"
    The correct answer is **B**.

    [Optimization](../../glossary.md#optimization) in chatbots involves systematically improving performance, efficiency, and effectiveness through techniques like refining prompts, adjusting parameters, improving retrieval, or optimizing infrastructure. Option A focuses only on code size, option C might harm functionality, and option D contradicts the efficiency goal.

## Question 6

<div class="upper-alpha" markdown>

Which of the following is a key metric for evaluating chatbot success?

1. The number of developers who built it
2. User satisfaction and task completion rate
3. The amount of code documentation
4. The color scheme of the interface

??? question "Show Answer"
    The correct answer is **B**.

    User satisfaction and task completion rate are key [chatbot metrics](../../glossary.md#chatbot-metrics) that directly measure whether the chatbot is successfully helping users achieve their goals. Option A relates to development team size, option C to documentation quality, and option D to visual design (which affects UX but isn't a direct success metric).

## Question 8

<div class="upper-alpha" markdown>

Why is continuous optimization important for chatbots?

1. It's required by law
2. User needs, language, and technology evolve, requiring ongoing improvements
3. It reduces the need for initial development
4. It eliminates all bugs permanently

??? question "Show Answer"
    The correct answer is **B**.

    Continuous [optimization](../../glossary.md#optimization) is important because user needs, language patterns, business requirements, and available technology all evolve over time. Regular optimization ensures the chatbot remains effective and competitive. Option A is false, option C is incorrect (initial development is still needed), and option D is unrealistic.

## Question 9

<div class="upper-alpha" markdown>

What is a common KPI for measuring chatbot efficiency?

1. The chatbot's age
2. Average response time or cost per conversation
3. The number of programming languages used
4. The size of the development team

??? question "Show Answer"
    The correct answer is **B**.

    Common efficiency [KPIs](../../glossary.md#key-performance-indicator) include average response time (how quickly users get answers) and cost per conversation (efficiency of resource usage). These metrics help organizations understand and optimize chatbot performance. Options A, C, and D are not relevant performance indicators.

## Question 10

<div class="upper-alpha" markdown>

What skills are valuable for a career in conversational AI?

1. Only artistic design skills
2. A combination of NLP knowledge, programming skills, and understanding of user experience
3. Only hardware engineering skills
4. Only sales and marketing skills

??? question "Show Answer"
