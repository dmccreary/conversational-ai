# Semantic Search and Quality Metrics

## Summary

This chapter advances your understanding of search by introducing semantic search techniques that go beyond simple keyword matching, along with methods for measuring search quality. You will learn about metadata tagging, vector-based similarity measures, ranking algorithms like Page Rank and TF-IDF, and critical evaluation metrics including precision, recall, and F-measures. These concepts enable you to build more intelligent search systems and objectively assess their performance.
