# Large Language Models and Tokenization

## Summary

This chapter introduces large language models (LLMs), the powerful AI systems that enable modern conversational agents to understand and generate human-like text. You will learn about transformer architecture, the attention mechanism that makes LLMs effective, and the critical process of tokenization that converts text into units processable by neural networks. These concepts form the foundation for understanding how chatbots generate intelligent responses.

## Concepts Covered
