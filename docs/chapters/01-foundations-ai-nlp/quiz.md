#### 1. What is the primary characteristic that defines Artificial Intelligence?

<div class="upper-alpha" markdown>
1. The ability to store large amounts of data
2. The simulation of human intelligence processes by machines
3. The use of the internet to connect computers
4. The creation of robots with physical movement capabilities
</div>

??? question "Show Answer"
    The correct answer is **B**. Artificial Intelligence refers to the simulation of human intelligence processes by machines, including learning, reasoning, and self-correction. Option A describes data storage (not intelligence), option C describes networking, and option D describes robotics which is only one application of AI.

    **Concept Tested:** Artificial Intelligence

    **See:** [AI Definition](index.md#what-is-artificial-intelligence)

#### 2. Which type of AI system is designed to perform specific tasks rather than general reasoning?

<div class="upper-alpha" markdown>
1. General AI (Strong AI)
2. Narrow AI (Weak AI)
3. Quantum AI
4. Distributed AI
</div>

??? question "Show Answer"
    The correct answer is **B**. Narrow AI (Weak AI) refers to systems designed for specific tasks like facial recognition or voice assistants. General AI (option A) would have human-like cognitive abilities across diverse domains but doesn't yet exist. Options C and D are not standard AI categories in this context.

    **Concept Tested:** Artificial Intelligence

#### 3. What significant event occurred in 1956 that established AI as a field of study?

<div class="upper-alpha" markdown>
1. The invention of the internet
2. The creation of the first computer
3. The Dartmouth Conference that coined the term "Artificial Intelligence"
4. The launch of the first smartphone
</div>

??? question "Show Answer"
    The correct answer is **C**. The 1956 Dartmouth Conference, organized by John McCarthy, Marvin Minsky, and others, officially coined the term "Artificial Intelligence" and established it as a distinct field of study. This marked the formal beginning of AI research.

    **Concept Tested:** AI Timeline

#### 4. How does the AI Doubling Rate compare to Moore's Law?

<div class="upper-alpha" markdown>
1. AI doubling occurs at the same rate as Moore's Law
2. AI doubling occurs more slowly than Moore's Law
3. AI doubling occurs more rapidly than Moore's Law
4. There is no relationship between the two
</div>

??? question "Show Answer"
    The correct answer is **C**. The AI Doubling Rate shows that AI training compute has doubled approximately every 3.4 months in recent years, far exceeding Moore's Law's approximately 24-month doubling period. This explains why AI capabilities have advanced so rapidly in recent years.

    **Concept Tested:** AI Doubling Rate

    **See:** [AI Doubling Rate](index.md#the-exponential-growth-of-ai-capabilities)

#### 5. What observation does Moore's Law describe?

<div class="upper-alpha" markdown>
1. The doubling of internet users every year
2. The doubling of transistors on integrated circuits approximately every two years
3. The halving of computer prices annually
4. The doubling of AI research papers each decade
</div>

??? question "Show Answer"
    The correct answer is **B**. Moore's Law, articulated by Intel co-founder Gordon Moore in 1965, observes that the number of transistors on integrated circuits doubles approximately every two years. This has driven exponential increases in computational power while costs decrease, enabling the development of modern AI systems.

    **Concept Tested:** Moore's Law

#### 6. What is the primary focus of Natural Language Processing?

<div class="upper-alpha" markdown>
1. Creating visual graphics for computers
2. Enabling computers to understand and generate human language
3. Improving computer hardware performance
4. Developing new programming languages
</div>

??? question "Show Answer"
    The correct answer is **B**. Natural Language Processing (NLP) is the field of artificial intelligence focused on enabling computers to understand, interpret, and generate human language in meaningful ways. This is fundamental to conversational AI systems.

    **Concept Tested:** Natural Language Processing

    **See:** [NLP Introduction](index.md#natural-language-processing)

#### 7. Which NLP task involves breaking text into smaller units for processing?

<div class="upper-alpha" markdown>
1. Text compression
2. Text encryption
3. Text processing and tokenization
4. Text deletion
</div>

??? question "Show Answer"
    The correct answer is **C**. Text processing includes operations like tokenization, which breaks text into smaller units (tokens) such as words or subwords for analysis and processing by NLP systems. This is a fundamental preprocessing step for most NLP applications.

    **Concept Tested:** Text Processing

    **See:** [Text Processing](index.md#text-processing-fundamentals)

#### 8. What is the purpose of string matching in text processing?

<div class="upper-alpha" markdown>
1. To encrypt sensitive information
2. To find occurrences of a character sequence within text
3. To compress files for storage
4. To translate text between languages
</div>

??? question "Show Answer"
    The correct answer is **B**. String matching is the process of finding occurrences of a character sequence (pattern) within another string, which is fundamental to text search and retrieval systems.

    **Concept Tested:** String Matching

    **See:** [String Matching](index.md#string-matching-techniques)

#### 9. Regular expressions are primarily used for which purpose?

<div class="upper-alpha" markdown>
1. Solving mathematical equations
2. Pattern matching and text searching with compact syntax
3. Creating graphical user interfaces
4. Managing database transactions
</div>

??? question "Show Answer"
    The correct answer is **B**. Regular expressions are patterns that describe sets of strings, used for text searching, matching, and manipulation with compact and powerful syntax. They're essential tools for text processing and validation.

    **Concept Tested:** Regular Expressions

    **See:** [Regular Expressions](index.md#regular-expressions)

#### 10. What is the grep command primarily used for?

<div class="upper-alpha" markdown>
1. Graphically displaying data charts
2. Searching text using patterns and regular expressions
3. Compiling programming code
4. Managing file permissions
</div>

??? question "Show Answer"
    The correct answer is **B**. The grep command is a command-line utility for searching text using patterns, widely used for finding specific strings or regular expressions in files. It's a fundamental tool for text processing in Unix-like systems.
