# The Retrieval Augmented Generation Pattern

## Summary

This chapter introduces the Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) pattern, a powerful technique that enhances LLM responses by retrieving relevant information from external knowledge sources. You will learn about the three-step RAG process (retrieval, augmentation, generation), how to work with both public and private knowledge bases, prompt engineering techniques, context windows, and important limitations including hallucination. The RAG pattern is essential for building chatbots that provide accurate, up-to-date information grounded in specific knowledge sources.
