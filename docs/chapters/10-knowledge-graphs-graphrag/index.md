# Knowledge Graphs and GraphRAG

## Summary

This chapter explores knowledge graphs as structured representations of information and introduces the GraphRAG pattern that combines graph databases with retrieval-augmented generation. You will learn about graph database fundamentals including nodes, edges, and triples, query languages like Cypher and OpenCypher, the RDF standard, and how knowledge graphs can serve as the "corporate nervous system" for organizations. The GraphRAG pattern addresses many limitations of traditional RAG by leveraging the rich relationships encoded in knowledge graphs.
