## Question 1

<div class="upper-alpha" markdown>

What is user feedback in the context of chatbots?

1. Error messages from the system
2. Information provided by users about their experience and satisfaction
3. Automated test results
4. Server performance metrics

??? question "Show Answer"
    The correct answer is **B**.

    [User feedback](../../glossary.md#user-feedback) is information provided by users about their experience, satisfaction, and the quality of chatbot responses. This can include explicit feedback (ratings, comments) and implicit feedback (conversation abandonment, completion rates). Option A describes system errors, option C describes testing, and option D describes infrastructure metrics.

## Question 2

<div class="upper-alpha" markdown>

What is a feedback loop?

1. A programming error that causes infinite repetition
2. A system where outputs are fed back as inputs to drive continuous improvement
3. A circular user interface design
4. A network routing error

??? question "Show Answer"
    The correct answer is **B**.

    A [feedback loop](../../glossary.md#feedback-loop) is a system where outputs (like user feedback and interaction data) are fed back as inputs to improve the system continuously. In chatbots, this means using user feedback to refine responses, update training data, and improve performance over time. Option A describes a bug, option C describes UI design, and option D describes network issues.

## Question 3

<div class="upper-alpha" markdown>

What is the AI Flywheel?

1. A type of computer processor
2. A virtuous cycle where more data and usage leads to better AI, which attracts more users
3. A data visualization tool
4. A testing framework

??? question "Show Answer"
    The correct answer is **B**.

    The [AI Flywheel](../../glossary.md#ai-flywheel) is a virtuous cycle where more users generate more data, which improves the AI model, which attracts more users, creating a self-reinforcing cycle of improvement. This concept is key to understanding how successful AI products scale. Option A describes hardware, option C describes visualization tools, and option D describes testing.

## Question 4

<div class="upper-alpha" markdown>

What is continuous improvement in chatbot development?

1. Running the chatbot 24/7 without maintenance
2. The ongoing process of using feedback and data to iteratively enhance performance
3. Increasing server capacity
4. Adding more features regardless of user needs

??? question "Show Answer"
    The correct answer is **B**.

    [Continuous improvement](../../glossary.md#continuous-improvement) is the ongoing process of using feedback, analytics, and data to iteratively enhance chatbot performance. This includes refining responses, updating training data, fixing issues, and optimizing based on real user interactions. Option A describes uptime, option C describes scaling, and option D describes feature bloat without user focus.

## Question 5

<div class="upper-alpha" markdown>

What is acceptance rate in chatbot metrics?

1. The percentage of users who install the chatbot app
2. The percentage of chatbot responses that users find helpful or satisfactory
3. The percentage of servers accepting connections
4. The percentage of code passing tests

??? question "Show Answer"
    The correct answer is **B**.

    [Acceptance rate](../../glossary.md#acceptance-rate) measures the percentage of chatbot responses that users find helpful or satisfactory. This can be measured through explicit feedback (thumbs up/down) or implicit signals (user continuing the conversation vs. abandoning). Option A describes installation metrics, option C describes infrastructure, and option D describes code quality.

## Question 6

<div class="upper-alpha" markdown>

Which type of user feedback is most explicit?

1. Conversation abandonment
2. Time spent reading a response
3. Thumbs up/down ratings with optional comments
4. Number of messages in a conversation

??? question "Show Answer"
    The correct answer is **C**.

    Thumbs up/down ratings with optional comments are the most explicit form of [user feedback](../../glossary.md#user-feedback), as users are directly stating their satisfaction level. Options A, B, and D are implicit feedback signals that require interpretation but don't explicitly state user satisfaction.

</div>

## Question 7

<div class="upper-alpha" markdown>

How does the AI Flywheel benefit chatbot development?

1. It reduces development costs to zero
2. It creates a self-reinforcing cycle where more usage leads to better performance
3. It eliminates the need for human oversight
4. It makes the chatbot work without internet

??? question "Show Answer"
    The correct answer is **B**.

    The [AI Flywheel](../../glossary.md#ai-flywheel) creates a self-reinforcing cycle: more users → more interaction data → better AI models → better user experience → more users. This momentum helps successful chatbots improve faster over time. Option A is unrealistic, option C is dangerous (human oversight remains important), and option D is unrelated.

## Question 8

<div class="upper-alpha" markdown>

What is an example of implicit user feedback?

1. A 5-star rating
2. A written review
3. A user abandoning the conversation without completing their goal
4. Clicking a "Submit Feedback" button

??? question "Show Answer"
    The correct answer is **C**.

    Conversation abandonment is implicit [user feedback](../../glossary.md#user-feedback) - the user's behavior suggests dissatisfaction or failure to meet their needs, even though they haven't explicitly stated it. Options A, B, and D are all explicit feedback where users consciously provide their opinion.

## Question 9

<div class="upper-alpha" markdown>

Why is continuous improvement important for chatbots?

1. It's required by law
2. User expectations and language evolve, so chatbots must adapt to remain effective
3. It reduces storage costs
4. It eliminates the need for initial training

??? question "Show Answer"
    The correct answer is **B**.

    [Continuous improvement](../../glossary.md#continuous-improvement) is important because user expectations, language patterns, business needs, and product offerings all evolve over time. Without ongoing updates based on feedback, chatbots become stale and less effective. Option A is false, option C is not the primary reason, and option D is incorrect (initial training is still necessary).

## Question 10

<div class="upper-alpha" markdown>

What should you do with negative user feedback?

1. Ignore it to avoid discouragement
2. Delete it from the system
3. Analyze it to identify patterns and areas for improvement
4. Ban users who provide it

??? question "Show Answer"
    The correct answer is **C**.

    Negative [user feedback](../../glossary.md#user-feedback) is valuable for identifying issues and areas for improvement. Analyzing patterns in negative feedback helps prioritize fixes and enhancements. Options A and B waste valuable improvement opportunities, and option D would alienate users and prevent learning from their experiences.
