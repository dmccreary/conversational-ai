# NLP Pipelines and Text Processing

## Summary

This chapter covers NLP pipelines and advanced text processing techniques that prepare raw text for analysis and understanding by conversational AI systems. You will learn about text preprocessing steps including normalization, stemming, and lemmatization, as well as linguistic analysis techniques like part-of-speech tagging, dependency parsing, and coreference resolution. These NLP pipeline components are essential for extracting structured information from unstructured text.

## Concepts Covered

This chapter covers the following 8 concepts from the learning graph:

1. NLP Pipeline
2. Text Preprocessing
3. Text Normalization
4. Stemming
5. Lemmatization
6. Part-of-Speech Tagging
7. Dependency Parsing
8. Coreference Resolution

## Prerequisites

This chapter builds on concepts from:

- [Chapter 1: Foundations of Artificial Intelligence and Natural Language Processing](../01-foundations-ai-nlp/index.md)
