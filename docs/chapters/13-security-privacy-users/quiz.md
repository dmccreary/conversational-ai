3. Encrypting all files
4. Deleting old data

    The correct answer is **B**.

    [Data privacy](../../glossary.md#data-privacy) is the practice of protecting personal information from unauthorized access and ensuring it's collected, stored, and used in compliance with privacy laws and user expectations. It encompasses consent, transparency, and user rights. Option A contradicts privacy, option C is one technique but not the whole concept, and option D is about retention.

## Question 8

<div class="upper-alpha" markdown>

What is the difference between authentication and authorization?

1. They are the same thing
2. Authentication verifies identity; authorization determines permissions
3. Authorization comes before authentication
4. They are unrelated concepts

??? question "Show Answer"
    The correct answer is **B**.

    [Authentication](../../glossary.md#authentication) verifies who you are (identity), while [authorization](../../glossary.md#authorization) determines what you're allowed to do (permissions). Authentication always comes first - you can't authorize someone until you know who they are. Option A is false, option C is backwards, and option D is incorrect.

## Question 9

<div class="upper-alpha" markdown>

Why is RBAC useful in chatbot systems?

1. It makes the chatbot respond faster
2. It allows different users to have different levels of access and capabilities
3. It reduces database size
4. It improves the user interface

??? question "Show Answer"
    The correct answer is **B**.

    [RBAC](../../glossary.md#role-based-access-control) allows chatbot systems to provide different levels of access and capabilities to different users based on their roles. For example, admins might access sensitive data while regular users cannot. This improves security and enables appropriate access control. Option A relates to performance, option C to storage, and option D to design.

## Question 10

<div class="upper-alpha" markdown>

What should chatbots do with user PII to comply with privacy regulations?

1. Share it publicly for transparency
2. Collect only necessary PII, store it securely, and provide users with control over their data
3. Never collect any data
4. Store it indefinitely without deletion

??? question "Show Answer"
    The correct answer is **B**.

    To comply with privacy regulations like [GDPR](../../glossary.md#gdpr), chatbots should follow privacy best practices: collect only necessary [PII](../../glossary.md#pii), store it securely, obtain proper consent, provide transparency, and give users control over their data including the ability to access, correct, or delete it. Option A violates privacy, option C makes many services impossible, and option D violates data retention principles.
