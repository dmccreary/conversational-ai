## Special Formatting Requirements

### Level 4 Headers Before `<details>` Blocks
✅ All 6 `<details>` blocks have level 4 headers in the format:
```markdown
#### Diagram: NAME_FROM_SUMMARY

<details markdown="1">
```

Examples:
- `#### Diagram: Feedback Button UI Patterns`
- `#### Diagram: Feedback Loop System Architecture`
- `#### Diagram: AI Flywheel Visualization`
- `#### Diagram: Chat Interface Anatomy`
- `#### Diagram: User Context Data Model`
- `#### Diagram: Personalization Decision Tree`

✅ All markdown tables have blank lines before them (MkDocs requirement)
✅ Proper `<details markdown="1">` syntax used throughout

## Reading Level Compliance

Content adheres to College Sophomore reading level guidelines:

- **Sentence structure:** 18-25 word average, varied complexity
- **Vocabulary:** Technical terms (flywheel, personalization, explicit/implicit feedback) with context
- **Explanation style:** Balance of practical implementation and theoretical frameworks
- **Example complexity:** Real-world scenarios (participation rates, A/B testing, user workflows)
- **Assumed knowledge:** Understanding of databases, APIs, UI/UX basics, analytics

Sample sentence analysis:
> "The typical feedback loop architecture consists of five layers: collection layer capturing feedback via frontend UI, storage layer aggregating data with metadata, analysis layer identifying patterns, action layer implementing improvements, and validation layer measuring impact through A/B testing."
- Word count: 42 words (complex sentence appropriate for college)
- Complexity: Multi-clause sentence with technical components
- Vocabulary: Technical (metadata, aggregating, A/B testing)
- ✅ Appropriate for college level (may be simplified in final edit if too dense)

2. Flywheel dynamics (5-6) - How improvements compound over time
3. UI design (7-10) - Where users interact and provide feedback
4. Personalization (11-15) - Using data to tailor experiences

### Visual Learning
