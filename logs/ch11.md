## Progress

### Step 1: Verify Chapter File Exists ✓
- Chapter file verified and read successfully

### Step 2: Verify Chapter Content ✓
- Title: NLP Pipelines and Text Processing
- Summary: Comprehensive summary present
- Concepts Covered: 8 concepts
  1. NLP Pipeline
  2. Text Preprocessing
  3. Text Normalization
  4. Stemming
  5. Lemmatization
  6. Part-of-Speech Tagging
  7. Dependency Parsing
  8. Coreference Resolution

### Step 3: Get Reading Level ✓
- Reading level from course-description.md: **College Sophomores**
- Will use college-level sentence structure, vocabulary, and examples

### Step 4: Generate Detailed Chapter Content ✓
Generated comprehensive educational content with:
- College-level reading complexity (18-25 word sentences, technical terminology, academic style)
- Pedagogical ordering: NLP Pipeline → Text Preprocessing → Normalization → Stemming → Lemmatization → POS Tagging → Dependency Parsing → Coreference Resolution
- Rich non-text elements throughout
- Interactive elements for student engagement
- Level 4 headers (####) before each <details> block
- Word count: ~6,800 words

### Step 5: Verify Completeness ✓

**Concept Coverage Verification:**

All 8 concepts from the learning graph covered:

1. ✓ **NLP Pipeline** - Covered in "The NLP Pipeline Architecture" section with architectural diagram
2. ✓ **Text Preprocessing** - Covered in dedicated section "Text Preprocessing: Cleaning and Preparing Raw Input"
3. ✓ **Text Normalization** - Covered as major subsection under Text Preprocessing with table examples
4. ✓ **Stemming** - Covered in "Stemming: Reducing Words to Root Forms" with comparison table
5. ✓ **Lemmatization** - Covered in "Lemmatization: Morphological Analysis for True Root Forms" with interactive MicroSim
6. ✓ **Part-of-Speech Tagging** - Covered in "Part-of-Speech Tagging: Identifying Grammatical Roles" with workflow diagram
7. ✓ **Dependency Parsing** - Covered in "Dependency Parsing: Uncovering Sentence Structure" with parse tree diagram
8. ✓ **Coreference Resolution** - Covered in "Coreference Resolution: Tracking References Across Sentences" with interactive MicroSim

**Non-Text Elements Summary:**

- **Markdown lists:** 20+ lists (used extensively throughout for enumerating concepts)
- **Markdown tables:** 8 tables
  1. Tokenization comparison (naive vs linguistic)
  2. Normalization pipeline stages
  3. Stemming benefits/problems
  4. Stemming vs lemmatization comparison
  5. POS tagging example sentence
  6. Dependency parsing ambiguity examples
  7. Coreference types comparison
  8. Pipeline complexity vs latency trade-offs

- **Diagrams:** 4 detailed specifications
  1. NLP Pipeline Architecture (layered diagram)
  2. Dependency Parse Tree Visualization
  3. POS Tagging Process Flow (workflow)
  4. Production Pipeline Architecture with Error Handling

- **MicroSims:** 3 interactive simulations
  1. Interactive Tokenization Comparison MicroSim
  2. Stemming vs Lemmatization Interactive Comparison MicroSim
  3. Coreference Resolution Interactive Demo

**Interactive Elements:** 3 MicroSims (all require microsim-p5 skill for implementation)

**Content Quality:**
- All level 4 headers (####) properly placed before <details> blocks as requested
- College-level vocabulary and sentence structure maintained throughout
- Conversational AI context integrated into all examples
- Blank lines properly placed before all markdown lists and tables
- Real-world examples from chatbot use cases throughout
